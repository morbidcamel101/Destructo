## THE BRIEF

Captain Destructo has his own private island. A small world full of combat drones. The captain’s weapon of choice is a weapon called the MOAG with powerful nuclear capabilities. The nuclear rocket attachment is especially effective at taking out multiple enemies at once. The scope is a must use accessory and the captain executes his kills with precision.

Captain Destructo has never been killed until now….

We are very pleased with the result although with a little bit more time we could have unleashed the code! The code allows for amazing flexibility it was surreal to see it all come together so quickly in the end. We donate our journey to the public realm with the hopes of inspiring more indie developers to take the dare!

@morbidcamel101‘s > Recommendation – use the scope!
